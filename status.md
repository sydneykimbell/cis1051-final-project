Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, we have the framework for the 2048 grid. We also added keyboard input to move and functions to merge blocks on the grid, shift the board in a given direction, and detect if the user has the 2048 tile.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not added a GUI for the game or debugged the currents functions/combined them in a way that the user can complete a full game of 2048.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I initially had problems setting up the grid, which were then resolved. Currently, I am having problems adding graphics to the game and setting up the GUI.
