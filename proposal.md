# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

2048 game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

2048 is a merging game involving blocks with powers of 2 on a 4x4 grid. The goal of the game is to merge enough blocks to get the 2048 block.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The object of the game 2048 is to combine the blocks in powers of 2 to get the 2048 block. After each move, a new block (either a 2 or a 4) will appear. If there are no more blocks that are able to be combined, the user will lose. But if the user obtains the 2048 block, the user wins. Our game will have graphics created using Pygame.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, the 2048 game will have a fully functable grid where the user is able to move around and combine the blocks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In a better outcome, the 2048 game will have graphics and look somewhat visually appealing. The game will be able to detect when the user has no moves and when the user obtains the 2048 block to show win/loss.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In a best outcome, the game will be fully functable with input from the arrow keys. The game will also accumulate xp when 2 blocks are combined. When the game ends, the screen will display a win/loss screen that tells the user their total xp collected during the game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To create the 2048 game, the two main things we will need to research are GUI interfaces and matrix/linear algebra logic. Because the game board is a matrix, most of the logic of the game uses linear algebra concepts, such as transposing a matrix. We will also need to learn how to use multidimensional arrays/lists. We plan to use Pygame to create the graphics, so we will need to research the functions of Pygame. To divide up the work, Corinne will focus on creating the graphics and learning how Pygram functions, while Joann and I focus on creating the logic of the game and learning how matrices function. All of us will work on debugging and compiling the code to make sure the game fully functions.
